To run the Python code yourself, please clone this repo, install IPython (on Python 2.7) and run
`ipython notebook` in the repo directory. We highly recommend installing the Anaconda Python distribution, which includes IPython, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and mostly anything else used throughout the book:

To run the R code, please clone this repo, install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
and either `Knit` the entire document (⇧⌘K) or run each code chunk
interactively.
